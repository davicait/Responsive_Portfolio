             Hello World! Welcome to my first official website since enrolling in DU's Coding Bootcamp.
            </p>

         <p>The decision to enroll in bootcamp has completely turned my life upsdie down.
             I used to work for a retail company; managing 40+ employees, executing unique brand launches, and
                 integrating new technology into everyday workflow. 
             </p>

        <p>Coding already feels like a better fit... I look forward to a new life behind my computer screen.
                 I can't wait to see where this journey takes me, and I plan on having a great time learning
                 along the way.
            </p>
